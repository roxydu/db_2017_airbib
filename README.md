## Abstract

We are to implement a database and provide a front-end website for querying data. The use case in our case is AirBnb, and we will be using MySQL database which is hosted on Amazon Web Services (AWS).

In order to utilize our data from MySQL database, we will be using a Node.js server on AWS EC2. It basically queries the data from the database and sends the data through http POST's.

Last, a website will use jQuery's ```jQuery.getScript()``` method or ```jQuery.getJSON()``` method to get the data through the RESTful API, and displays it in a nice format.
